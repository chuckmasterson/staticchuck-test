# Test site for Staticman hosted on Heroku

Nothing to see here really. A few of the commits I made may be helpful to someone or other, but mostly this is just the same as [Vincent Tam's repo I forked](https://github.com/VincentTam/TestStaticmanLab), and you should use his excellent instructions if you want to do the thing we did.

I never got the reCaptcha working on this site but I figured it out for my [real site](http://www.chuckmasterson.com). You've got to change the encrypted secret in both the config file and the form it's sent from.
